# Introduction and scope
Currently the Covid-19 pandemic has become an "enemy of humanity"[1] according to the World Health Organization. <br />
Given this situation, we have seen that the main public health problem is in the number of artificial respirators and masks available [2]. <br />
So we decided to work on finding a solution and develop a prototype that can be done by personal and industrial approach.<br />
As part of the good practices to be able to solve a problem, we must first identify the main parameters to be controlled. 
With this in mind we made an investigation on this topic. See Annex A. <br />
Based on our research, the factors to control are: <br />
•	Oxygen concentration. <br />
•	Total volume of air flow. <br />
•	Respiratory rate per minute. <br />
•	Oxygen pressure. <br /> <br />
The first point involves a process of production of oxygen at a certain concentration and its regulation by valves; <br />
the last three points imply mechanical-electrical development. <br /><br />
On the other hand, to build the solution we must take seven main points in the design of the solution: <br />
1.	It must be built with common materials and access to industrial production lines. <br />
2.	Meet medical specifications. <br />
3.	Insurance. <br />
4.	It can be decontaminated, cleaned and reused. <br />
5.	Lower monetary cost compared to a common breathing system. <br />
6.	It's easy to build, maintain and upgrade. <br />
7.	Scalable in improvements. <br /><br />

With all the above in mind, we present you our proposal consisting of: <br />
1.	Oxygen concentrator. <br />
2.	Mechanical-electric respirator. (Design, motor, valves, Arduino and accessories, sensors and control system). <br />
3.	Mask. <br /><br />

Important:
The oxygen concentrator showed does not produce 99% concentrated oxygen and does not generate enough pressure to fill medical oxygen tanks. <br />
If you want to increase concentration and pressure you need more expensive materials and equipment. <br />
By using air filters, we removed much of the impurities in form of powder or particles suspended so the oxygen concentrated can be breathed without complications. <br />
The electric mechanical respirator can be printed with a 3-D printer or produced in parts at an industrial level by cutting material. <br />
The mask can be printed with a 3-D printer or you can create it by hand. <br />
This solution must only be used in mild to moderate cases when there is a partial substitution of the respiratory capacity, which means no intubation or entering systems to the trachea- lungs. <br />
The most severe cases require specialized machinery since sometimes there must be up to 99% oxygen concentration. <br />
For the replacement of the total respiratory capacity at the mechanical-electrical respirator level, we are working on a software update and new sensor connections-components to the Arduino, however, due to issues of time, budget and obtaining parts we have some delays. <br />
