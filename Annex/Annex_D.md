## Recommendations for the use of oxygen cylinders

Although the oxygen concentrator does not have an oxygen cylinder in its conceptual design, it is more like a possible extension through the use of a compressor and an oxygen tank, the same recommendations should be considered when operating with concentrated oxygen at high pressure.<br /><br />
•	Always make sure that oxygen is flowing before placing the administration device over the patient's mouth and nose.<br />
•	Do not use oxygen near flames or sparks. Oxygen intensifies the flames. Do not smoke or allow anyone else to smoke around oxygen in transport, in use, or on standby.<br />
•	Do not use grease, oil, or petroleum products to lubricate or clean the pressure regulator or any connecting hose, etc. This could cause an explosion.<br />
•	Do not place the oxygen cylinders in an upright position unless they are well secured.<br />
•	If the cylinder falls, the regulator or valve could be damaged or cause injury.<br />
•	Do not attach the valve caps or protectors when moving or lifting the cylinders.<br />
•	Do not deface, alter, or remove any labels or markings on the oxygen cylinder.<br />
•	Do not try to mix gases in an oxygen cylinder or transfer oxygen from one cylinder to another.<br />
•	Never use oxygen without a secure regulator that is properly adjusted.<br />
•	When the tank is not in use, keep the valves closed even if the tank is empty. Store the oxygen tanks below 125°F.<br />
•	If you are defibrillating, make sure that no one touches or is in contact with the victim or the resuscitation team.<br />
•	Do not De-fibrate someone near flammable materials, such as free-flowing gasoline or oxygen.<br />
•	Never drag or roll the cylinders.<br />
•	When you must move a cylinder, always hold the cylinder with both hands and never by the valve or regulator.<br />
•	Do not store oxygen cylinders near flammable or water heaters, near electrical or telephone booths, where anything heavy may fall on them, where they may tip over or be exposed to heat or direct sunlight.<br />
•	When transporting oxygen bottles: do not store them in the trunk; secure them in the event of a sudden stop, acceleration, or sharp turn, when they can become a serious projectile hazard; remove them immediately from the vehicle instead of risking exposure to heat, which could cause a potentially dangerous gas release.<br /><br />
