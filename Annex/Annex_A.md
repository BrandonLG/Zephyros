## Mechanical ventilation
Here you will understand the main reasons of mechanical ventilation procedure.

## Introduction
Mechanical ventilation is a resource of medical therapy used to give life support whose objective is to support or replace respiratory function until the total or partial reversal of the underlying problem that caused respiratory failure.<br />
The knowledge and understanding of physiological and pathophysiological processes together with the constant improvement of mechanical ventilators based on technological advances have improved the survival of patients in critical condition.<br />

## Pulmonary ventilation physiology
The lungs are elastic structures with resistance to volume expansion. Under normal conditions, the lung contains air inside it by positive pressure and external negative pressure in the pleural space.<br />
Under normal conditions, the lungs adjust to the chest walls. There is a volume level at which the lung tendency to contract and the tendency of the chest wall to expand are the same, this being the resting position of the respiratory system. This is known as "Residual Functional Capacity" (CFR).<br />
During inspiration (inhalation), muscular force overcomes lung and rib cage retraction, however, as the lungs fill with air, there comes a point where the elastic and muscular retraction forces equalize, making it impossible to incorporate more volume. To airspace. This phenomenon is known as "total lung capacity" (CPT).<br />
Expiration (exhaling) is a passive process induced by the elastic force of pulmonary retraction that ranges from CPT to CFR. By continuing to expel air to levels below the CFR, a pulmonary contraction is carried out, however, an elastic counter-force of expansion is necessary to prevent lung collapse by equating said expansion force with the muscular force, the residual volume (VR) is obtained, this means the lung cannot expelled any more air.<br />

## Parameters that assess respiratory function
See Image 1 along with the reading.<br />
Two types of lung volumes are divided into static and dynamic.<br />
Static lung volumes: They are the ones that measure the volume of gas in the different positions of the rib cage. There are four volumes and four capacities resulting from the sum of the previous ones. <br /><br />

Volumes:
	Residual volume (VR): Volume contained in the lungs after a maximum expiration (approximately 1,200 ml).<br />
	Tidal volume (CV): Mobilized volume at rest (approximately 500ml).<br />
	Inspiratory Reserve Volume (VRI): volume that can be inspired after a normal inspiration (approximately 3,000ml = 3 L).<br />
	Expiratory reserve volume (VRE): Volume that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation (approximately 1 100ml = 1.1 L).<br /><br />

Capacities to consider for the machine:
	Total Lung Capacity (CPT): Volume of gas contained in the lungs at maximum inspiration (approximately 5,800 ml).<br />
	Vital Capacity (CV): Maximum exhaled gas volume one maximum inspiration (exhalation) (approximately 4,600 ml = 4.6 L).<br />
	Inspiratory capacity (IC): Maximum inspired volume (approximately 3,500ml = 3,500 L).<br />
	Functional residual capacity (CFR): Volume of gas contained in the lungs after normal expiration (2,300ml = 2.3 L).<br /><br />

Dynamic lung volumes:
	Forced Vital Capacity (CVF): Total volume exhaled through a maximum forced expiration.<br />
	Vef1 / Fev1: Volume of gas exhaled during the first second of exhalation.<br />
	FEF: Air flow in the middle part of expiration (between 25% and 75% of CVF).<br />
	FEV1 / CVF ratio: Known as the Tiffeneau index (it is considered pathological with a level below 0.7). In invasive breathing.<br /><br />

## Clinical indications
Type I respiratory failure or severe hypoxemia: hypoxemia with normal or low PaCO2, increased alveolar-arterial O 2 gradient (AaPO2> 20 mmHg). PaO2 of less than 50 mmHg, decrease in arterial oxygen saturation and content, despite administering supplemental oxygen at a concentration equal to or greater than 50%, either through a venturi mask or a mask with a reservoir. It is the most common type of IR. To diagnose the above you need to do an arterial blood gas.<br />
Respiratory failure II or hypercapnic: hypoxemia with elevated PaCO2 and normal alveolar-arterial O2 gradient (AaPO2 <20 mmHg), decrease in pH below 7.25, and the life of the patient is at risk. To diagnose you need to do an arterial blood gas.<br />
Neuromuscular compromise of respiration: Demyelinating diseases or post traumatic injuries of the spinal cord or central nervous system.<br />
Intracranial trauma: for initial management with controlled hyperventilation.<br />
Hemodynamic instability: marked reduction in PvCO2, unstable blood pressure.<br />

Basic and initial programming of the fan
Ventilator mode: It is the first parameter to be programmed. Must be started in controlled or assisted / controlled mode (Invasive only). The volume-controlled mode allows evaluating the patient's respiratory mechanics, reserving the pressure-controlled one for circumstances where there is a compromise of compliance or resistance.
FiO2: In most cases it will be started with an inspiratory fraction of oxygen of 100% for 15 to 20 minutes to seek to resolve any possible hypoxic situation. Subsequently, it will be regulated based on pulse oximetry, seeking that the patient's saturation level be at least 92%. It will decrease the FiO2 at intervals of 10-20 minutes with changes of 10 percentage points hast to wear less than 50% of FiO2 to avoid unwanted effects. An oximeter is required on hand.

Tidal Volume / Running Air Volume (VT): 6 - 8 cc (ml) of volume per kilogram of ideal weight will be programmed at the beginning. The ideal weight calculation will be made with the formula shown in Table 3 if the patient's weight is not known. The programmed volume should not exceed 35 cm of peak inspiratory negative pressure to avoid complications such as:
Barotrauma or volume-trauma. If this level is exceeded, the programmed tidal volume should be lowered to 4cc (ml) per kg of ideal weight.

Table 3. - Calculation of ideal weight (PI).
Man 50 + 0.91 [Height (cm) - 152.4]
Female 45 + 0.91 [Height (cm) - 152.4]

Respiratory rate: will start with a respiratory rate of 12 - 16 breaths per minute. For the regularization of this parameter, the calculation of the minute volume (VM) that is given by the relation should be considered:
VM = FR x VT        Eq.1
Sensitivity: Control that programs the ventilator response regarding the patient's respiratory effort (vital capacity); it can be programmed by pressure (non-invasive) or by flow (invasive). The higher the programmed absolute value, the greater the effort on the part of the patient will have to reach the sensitivity level and could lead to exhaustion. When programmed by flow in positive liters / minute values, a flow is generated precisely in which it is available at all times for the patient, who only has to make a minimum effort to reach the flow level for the ventilator to recognize said effort and provides scheduled ventilator support.
Inspiratory Flow / Peak Flow: Controls the rate at which the tidal volume (of flowing air) (VT) is delivered or the time at which the programmed inspiratory pressure is applied, thus determining the inspiratory time (highest flow rate = less time to fulfill the programmed volume).
Flow wave pattern: Indicates the way in which the inspiratory flow is delivered, the inspiratory time, the tidal volume and the inspiration / expiration ratio (inhalation / exhalation) must be evaluated; three being the most frequently found in the fans described in Table 4.
Table 4. - Flow wave pattern.
a) Constant flow or square wave: it delivers the volume in less time but generates more pressure in the airway than the others.

b) Decreasing or descending ramp flow: it generates a higher airway pressure at the beginning and an almost equal alveolar pressure; it distributes the tidal volume better, also promotes a longer inspiratory time at the expense of expiratory time.
c) Sine flow: it distributes the flow similar to the previous one but increases the inspiratory time even more, some authors believe that it is the closest thing to the physiological one.

Inspiratory Time and I: E Ratio: Inspiratory time is regulated taking into account how long it takes the patient to deliver the programmed volume or pressure. In addition, it should be noted that it is not too short to generate discomfort in the patient, nor too long that it hinders the time to expire and generates auto PEEP [2] as it cannot complete the exit of the gas supplied during inspiration.
The relationship between inspiration and exhalation or I:E. Must be always a 1: 2 ratio in such way that if we program FR at 20 per minute, we will have that inspiration will be in 1 second and expiration in 2 seconds, if we make changes in this I:E ratio we will also have to change the speed of flow since you must accomplish the inspiratory time as previously explained without problems in inspiration.

Important – Complications of mechanical ventilation
The possible complications expected during the entire process involving assisted mechanical ventilation (from intubation to mechanical weaning) vary according to the phase in which the ventilation is, they are indicated below:
During intubation: Trauma, aspiration of gastric contents, arrhythmias
During mechanical ventilation: wrong position or obstruction of the tube, accidental leakage of the tube from the trachea
Posterior to remove the trachea tube: commitment airway reflexes and sequelae laryngeal - tracheal.
Barotrauma: It is a serious complication with a mortality that ranges between 10 - 35% and increases when the diagnosis is delayed. 
It includes: alveolar interstitial emphysema, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumothorax. They all have in common the presence of air outside the airways.

Volume-trauma: Alveolar distention compresses the alveolar vessels, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, causing overload of the right ventricle, with the consequent displacement of the ventricular septum and decreased venous return.
Lung infection (NAV ventilator-associated pneumonia): We can define it as that lung infection that occurs after 48 hours of intubation or the start of mechanical ventilation}
Removal from mechanical ventilation – invasive total respiration only
Disconnection of the patient from mechanical ventilation. In the majority of patients, it was performed without complications, especially meeting the criteria described in Table 1. However, in patients with prolonged MV or with compromised lung reserve, they require progressive ventilator exercises and treatment based on bronchodilators.
Table 5. - Criteria for initiating weaning.
Resolution of the clinical picture
Hemodynamic stability
FiO2 less than 0.5
PEEP less than 5cm H2O (0.071 psi)

Patients will be classified into three different categories according to the ease of weaning as shown in Table 6 below.
Table 6. - Classification of weaning according to process.
Simple weaning : Weaning and extubation successful on the first attempt without complications
Difficult weaning: failure on the first attempt. Requires up to 3 separate attempts or 7 days for processing
Prolonged weaning: At least three previous attempts or 7 days for the process
