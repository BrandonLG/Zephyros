## Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA)

Generation of oxygen by the process Adsorption Pressure Swing (PSA) is a technology that separates oxygen (O2) of a gas mixture under pressure according to especial characteristics of adsorption selectiveness ng absorbers through a phenomenon of mass transfer transport and gas diffusion throughout the process. <br />
For this there are different types of material and s as for example, Carbo Molecular Sieve (CMS), activated carbon and zeolite<sup>1</sup>.<br /><br />

## Materials Specifications
The carbon molecular sieve is a nonpolar adsorbent, which has a different adsorption rate for oxygen and nitrogen.<br />
CMS contains small pores of a precise and uniform size that is used as an adsorbent for gases, they can have from 200 to 1200 m2 per gram<sup>2</sup>. When the pressure is high enough, oxygen molecules, which pass through the CMS pores much faster than nitrogen molecules , become trapped in the pores; With this , nitrogen molecules remain free in the gas stream, leaving an enriched nitrogen gas phase.<br />
The CMS releases oxygen when the system reduces pressure. This empties CMS pores so it can be ready for another cycle of nitrogen enriched air and oxygen production as a purge.<br />
CMS appears small, grains similar to black rice 1.0 x 2.0 mm in size and a density of about 650 g / L. Saturation is generally reached about 60 seconds under a pressure of 0.8 MP a (116 psi). CMS comes in different grades and models.<br /><br />

Activated carbon is an adsorbent material created from charcoal and has a different adsorption rate for oxygen and nitrogen.<br />
This material has a large number of uses, it can be used for spill cleanup, drinking water filtration, air purification, fuel storage for natural gas and hydrogen, etc.<br />
The small stones of the material contain n small pores of an irregular size and without pattern when they are generated in a homemade way.<br />
If the pressure is high enough, the nitrogen molecules, which pass through the carbon pores much faster than the oxygen molecules, are trapped inside the pores; then the molecules oxygen remains free within the gas stream, leaving a gas phase oxygen enriched. <br />
The activated carbon free nitrogen when the system reduces the pressure. This empties the pores of the material so it is ready for another cycle of production of enriched oxygen and nitrogen as a purge.<br />
Although activated carbon with standardized measures and properties exists in commercial products, when they are produced in an artisanal way, these properties and measures would not be guaranteed.<br /><br />

Zeolite is a stone composed mainly of aluminum and silicon, it has a structure with micro pores and it stands out for its ability to hydrate and dehydrate in a reversible way.<br />
Currently more than 206 types of zeolites have been identified and are usually found in conjunction with sedimentary, volcanic and metamorphic rocks.<br />
They are normally sold as commercial absorbents and are used for oil refining, coloring of liquids and gases, control of contaminants, water purification, etc.<br />
Currently there are artificial zeolites that have been designed for specific purposes and using sol-gel procedures.<br /><br />
